     1. Trinity College Library <br>
    <p>Located in Dublin, Ireland this library is home to one of the worlds oldest manuscript, <em>Books of Kells</em> which was illuminted by monks in the year 800. Trinity College Library also posesses the Ussher Collection which they acquired in 1661 and the Fagel Collection which they acquired in 1802. The library has beautiful, grand wooden arches and marble busts along the first floor. It is the largest library in all of Ireland and houses over 6 million books. Trinity College Library was established in 1592 and continues to be run today as part of the Trinity College in Dublin. This library also serves as the countries copyright library where all books that are applying for copyriht must be sent to acquire said copyright.

This library also does offer tours ot the public including one that allows tourists to view the <em>Book of Kells</em> and the Old Library Exhibit.  </p> <br>
    2. The Library of El Escorial <br>
    <p>Located in San Lorenzo de El Escorial, Spain this building includes not only a library but also a church and a monastary. The library building was finished in 1592 and is home to some of the most impressive collections of Renissance art in all of Spain. The ceilings of the library are all painted  frescoes by several famous 16th and 17th Spanish and Italian artists. These artists painting these frescoes also incorporated the seven liberal studies: logic, rhetoric, arithmetic, geometry, astronnomy, and music. This library also houses over 4,700 rare, illuminated manuscripts and more than 40,000 books. The art and architcture style of El Escorial is similar to the art and architecture style of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. This library is located in the same area that King Phillip II ruled Spain from and he is responsible for the addition of the library onto the monastary and church. He also contributed many books to the library that are still there today. El Ecorial does offer many tours and is now also considered a world heritage site.  </p> <br>
    3. Admont Abbey Library <br>
    <p>Located in Admont, Austria it is the world's largest monastery library. This library was completed in 1776 by Josef Hueber. The library itself has about 70,000 books while the entire Abbey owns over 200,000 volumes some of the most valuable manuscripts in the world reside here including over 1,400 manuscripts with some that date to around 8th century AD. Admont Abbey library also has acquired 530 books that were printed before 1500. The art and architecture in this library is the reason for much of its' fame with carvings of the "Four Last Things" which includes the effigies of Death, Heaven, Judgement, and Hell. The architecture is mainly inspired by the Enlightenment and boasts of beautiful cupolas and large windows that provide natural lighting. Admont Abbey's frescoes are similar to that of El Escorial's in that, they reflect education, but differ because the frescoes ultimately lead to the Divine Revelation which is directly above some of the monastaries Bibles and other various works done by the priests who have lived there. Visitors are encouraged and tours are offered to those who want it, but tourists are also free to explore the library on their own.</p><br>
    4. Strahov Monastary <br>
    <p>This library is located in Strhov, Czech Republic it is referred to as the Philosophy Hall in the monastery. It was built over many years but was eventually completed in the late 18th century. The Strahov Monastery library has well over 42,000 volumes and, like many other libraries built around that time, incorporated the use of frescoes to decorate the interior. These frescoes on the ceiling took only six months for one painter and his assistant to complete fully. They too refer to education and scientific revelations along with divine revelation throughout the library ceilings, the epiphany that these paintings lead to is that true knowledge can only be found through religion. This library also contains secret pasageways that are marked by books with false spines that lead to the corners of the hall. The Philosophy Hall became well- known in the late 18th century and the early 19th century and had many famous visitors, including but not limited to, Marie Louise who was the wife of Napoleon Bonaparte and Sir William Hamilton the hero of the Battle of Trafalgar. Tours are offered but tourists can also explore on their own and on their website they have a 3D tour that one can do from home. </p> <br>
